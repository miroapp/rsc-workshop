# Workshop

**TIP**: If you get lost in the middle of the workshop, don’t worry — we will take pauses and make sure everyone is on track. 

However, you can also checkout any of the branches on our GitHub repository to catch up at a particular point in the workshop:

**Milestone 1**
React server component and MomentJS \
https://github.com/miroapp/wearedevelopers-workshop/tree/moment-time 

**Milestone 2**

https://github.com/miroapp/wearedevelopers-workshop/tree/pages-and-routing 

**Milestone 3**
Server Actions \
https://github.com/miroapp/wearedevelopers-workshop/tree/server-actions 
 

▶ ️ **Important**: If you checkout any of these completed branches, don’t forget to update the .env file with your Miro app’s Client ID, Client Secret, and Redirect URL from the first part of the workshop!
